## LibreWrist App

*** Warning ***, This project is highly experimental! Please use this app with caution and extreme care. Do not make careless decisions based on software. Do not use this software if you are unsure.***

This software is free and open source. It is being developed out of personal needs, but everyone should be able to benefit from it.

It is not meant to replace the vendor's app, but rather enhance it and make diabetes life a bit easier. It is at a very early stage.
