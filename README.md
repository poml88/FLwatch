# LibreWrist App #

***Warning, This project is highly experimental! Please use this app with caution and extreme care. Do not make careless decisions based on software. Do not use this software if you are unsure. Don't use this App for medical decisions. It comes without absolutely no warranty. Use it at your own risk!***

This software is free and open source. It is being developed out of personal needs, but everyone should be able to benefit from it.

It is not meant to replace the vendor's app, but rather enhance it and make diabetes life a bit easier. It is at a very early stage.
For example it can do only mg/dL right now and watch and phone are not yet talking to each other. Many other shortcomings for now.
