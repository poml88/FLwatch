***Warning, This project is highly experimental! Please use this app with caution and extreme care. Do not make careless decisions based on software. Do not use this software if you are unsure. Don't use this App for medical decisions. It comes without absolutely no warranty. Use it at your own risk!***

This software is free and open source. It is being developed out of personal needs, but everyone should be able to benefit from it.

It is not meant to replace the vendor's app, but rather enhance it and make diabetes life a bit easier. It is at a very early stage.
For example there are no widgets or complications yet. Chart is not scrollable, because I don't know how to jump to the current data programmatically. Many other shortcomings for now.
